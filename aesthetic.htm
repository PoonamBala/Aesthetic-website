  <h1 id="C1">Sois belle a ta dacon.</h1>
<p>  <pre style="font-size:19px;">But I'd go anywhere to find you
My little heaven on earth,
But you wouldn't move an inch,
you'd never have to
I'd run to the rim of the world to catch you,
My eternal peace of mind,
Right before the dawn could get to you just - in time
I'd sing the songs in the lullabies
I'd read the myths of the ancient tribes
Just so I would know the prophecy
That you are somewhere in the galaxy,
After the sun sets, above the clouds, before the night comes and - or maybe behind the moon and all that we know to be true
I knew, I'd see you because
There was this stardust on the grand canyon
When I was young it made me feel a little hazy
But to find you my love, somewhere in this brand new world, I'd have to be somewhat crazy
So to complete my mission in life, I found out this :
My heart just might be whole as a traveler, but it's you that I miss.

The Morning Sun.
The girl that lived on the Grand Canyon.</pre>

  <p>Books are like a treasure, sometimes a treasure of knowledge, sometimes of learning new skills and sometimes of entertainment. The key to this treasure chest lies in acquiring the skill to read. Once that is done, a new world opens out to you. And the surprises and gems in this are never ending. The world of reading books is equally endless. From ancient times, whatever knowledge has been acquired, and recorded, about any subject under the sun, you will find in books.</p>
  <h2>What's my favourite?</h2>
  <p>There is nothing quite like fighting the good fight, and Harry Potter is the story of a kid obsessed with triumphing over evil, whatever guise that comes in. The good characters never shoot to kill, always put the safety of others before their own, and are themselves protected by the power and strength of love.</p>

   <h1  id="C3">Music</h1>
<p>“Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything.”</p>
  <h2>How does it help?</h2>
  <p>If you want to keep your brain engaged throughout the aging process, listening to or playing music is a great tool. It provides a total brain workout.” Research has shown that listening to music can reduce anxiety, blood pressure, and pain as well as improve sleep quality, mood, mental alertness, and memory.</p>
